# HaloHair Reservation App

## Overview

This mobile application is designed to streamline the process for both barbershop owners and customers. Barbershop owners can create a dedicated page for their salon, providing essential information such as location, services offered, and contact details. Customers, in turn, can easily book appointments at their preferred salon after creating an account on the application, which includes basic personal information.

## Problem Statement
